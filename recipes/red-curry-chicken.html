<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Thai red curry chicken is a quick and delicious soup with chicken, onions, and bell peppers. Enjoy hot with jasmine rice. If you like, add Thai basil leaves.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons red curry paste, or more to taste</li>
  <li>1 ½ pounds thin chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch strips</li>
  <li>1 (14 ounce) can unsweetened light coconut milk</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce, or more to taste</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon palm sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup sliced yellow onion</li>
  <li>1 cup sliced red bell pepper</li>
  <li>1 cup sliced yellow bell pepper</li>
  <li>1 cup sliced orange bell pepper</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
 	Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add oil and red curry paste to the hot pot; saute for 30 seconds. Add chicken and mix well with curry paste. Pour in coconut milk. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 2 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
  </li>
  <li>
 	Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
 	Unlock and remove the lid. Stir in fish sauce and palm sugar. Stir in onion and bell peppers until well combined. Select Saute function. Bring curry to a gentle boil and simmer for only 2 to 3 minutes to keep vegetables crunchy.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Cook's Notes:</h3>
<p>If you prefer a thicker curry, add only half a can of coconut milk.</p>
<p>If you are using thicker chicken breasts, increase cook time to 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Add more red curry paste for a spicier curry.</p>
